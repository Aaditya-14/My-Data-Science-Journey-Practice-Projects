# My-Data-Science-Journey-Practice-Projects
My hands-on data science journey. This repo showcases my practical skills in data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and machine learning. From Python fundamentals to model building, it reflects my progress and problem-solving approach across various datasets. A growing portfolio of my learning.

NumPy Practice
This folder contains my practice exercises and implementations focusing on NumPy fundamentals. It covers array creation, manipulation, broadcasting, universal functions (ufuncs), and linear algebra operations. Demonstrates core skills in efficient numerical computation in Python.

Pandas Practice
This folder showcases my Pandas proficiency in data manipulation and analysis. Includes exercises on DataFrames, Series, indexing, selection, filtering, grouping, merging, and handling missing data. Essential skills for transforming raw data into actionable insights.

DataVisualization Using Matplotlib
This section highlights my work in data visualization, focusing on creating insightful and compelling graphical representations of data. Through various projects and exercises, I demonstrate proficiency in using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate a diverse range of plots, including scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, and more complex statistical visualizations. My aim is to effectively communicate patterns, trends, and outliers, making complex data accessible and understandable for informed decision-making.

Data Collection: Web Scraping
This section contains my projects and scripts for data collection using web scraping. I demonstrate proficiency in using the requests library to send HTTP requests and the Beautiful Soup library to parse and navigate HTML content. These projects cover the entire data acquisition process, from fetching web pages and extracting specific information (e.g., product details, news headlines, or tables) to structuring the data for further analysis. This showcases my ability to gather raw, unstructured data from the web and transform it into a usable format.
